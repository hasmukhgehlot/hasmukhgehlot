Hello World 👋

👋 Hi there! I'm Hasmukh Gehlot, a seasoned full stack developer passionate about crafting intuitive and engaging experiences. My journey began with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, evolving into expertise with React, Next.js, Flask, and more. I specialize in developing efficient solutions that prioritize simplicity for smoother user experiences.

🌟 Recent projects include an offline search portal in React for categorized bookmarks and a custom PHP WordPress plugin for SEO management. I believe in delivering not just products, but impactful experiences tailored to client needs.

💡 Beyond coding, I enjoy mentoring college students and collaborating on projects, particularly in areas like cryptocurrency apps built with Ionic and React. Let's connect and build something awesome together!
